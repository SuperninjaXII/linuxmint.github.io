            Cinnamon is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems,
            which was originally based on GNOME 3, but follows traditional desktop metaphor conventions.

            The development of Cinnamon began by the Linux Mint team as the result of the April 2011 release of GNOME 3,
            in which the conventional desktop metaphor of GNOME 2 was discarded in favor of GNOME Shell. Following
            several attempts to extend GNOME 3 so that it would suit the Linux Mint design goals through "Mint GNOME
            Shell Extensions", the Linux Mint team eventually forked several GNOME 3 components to build an independent
            desktop environment. This separation from GNOME was finished with the release of Cinnamon 2.0.0 on 9 October
            2013. Applets, extensions, actions, and desklets made explicitly for Cinnamon are no longer compatible with
            GNOME Shell.

            As the distinctive factor and preeminent desktop environment for Linux Mint, Cinnamon has generally received
            favorable coverage by the press, in particular for its ease of use and gentle learning curve. In regard to
            its conservative design model, Cinnamon is similar to the Xfce, MATE, GNOME 2, and GNOME Flashback desktop
            environments.

            In 2016, Cinnamon started to use X-Apps,which are a collection of applications developed by the Linux Mint
            team as an alternative to GNOME Core Applications but intended to work across different GTK-based desktop
            environments such as but not limited to Cinnamon, Budgie, Pantheon, Unity, MATE, and XFCE; most of these
            applications have a traditional user interface (UI), for example, using a menu bar instead of a
            header-bar.Linux Mint team is currently in the process of transitioning development for X-Apps
            applications from being part of the Linux Mint development process to being a completely independent
            project.Most of them are forks of GNOME Core Applications:

            Timeshift is a system restore utility used to undo undesired system changes through the use of snapshots via
            BTRFS or rsync.[15]
            Blueberry is a graphical frontend for the CLI gnome-bluetooth library.
            Xed is a text editor based on Pluma
            Xviewer is an image viewer based on Eye of GNOME
            Xreader is a document viewer based on Atril
            Xplayer is a media player based on GNOME Videos (Totem)
            Pix is an image organizer based on gThumb
            gnome-online-accounts-gtk is a graphical online account manager for GTK-based desktop environments other
            than GNOME, due to recent changes in the GNOME Online Accounts package that now requires other desktop
            environments to be based on GTK4 rather than GTK3.
            libxapp is a Python and C-based software library that provides the resources needed for applications in the
            X-Apps project to work across different desktop environments.

            Linux Mint is a community-developed Linux distribution. It is based on Ubuntu and designed for x86-64 based
            computers; another variant is based on Debian which is named Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE) and has both
            64-bit and IA-32 support. The Linux Mint project started in 2006 and it has since become one of the most
            popular Linux operating systems for desktop PCs.
