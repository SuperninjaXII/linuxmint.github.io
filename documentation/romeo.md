# Romeo

The development team uses Romeo to push new BETA/ALPHA features.

> **Important:**  
> Romeo contains unstable builds and recent changes pushed by the developers on GitHub. By using it you'll upgrade from stable to unstable versions which might introduce regressions or not work at all.

## Enabling Romeo

To enable Romeo on your computer, open the **Software Sources** and check the option **"Unstable packages (romeo)"**.

## Upgrading software to unstable versions

Use the **Update Manager** to refresh and upgrade your software to unstable versions.

## Downgrading back to stable

To go back to stable versions, either restore a Timeshift snapshot, or disable Romeo (using the **Software Sources**), update the APT cache, and use the **Maintenance -> Downgrade foreign packages** section of the **Software Sources** tool.
