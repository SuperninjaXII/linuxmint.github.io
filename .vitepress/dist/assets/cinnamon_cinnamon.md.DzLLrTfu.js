It was very stable and very popular.</p><p>In 2011, Linux Mint 12 was unable to ship with GNOME 2. The upstream GNOME team had released a brand new desktop (GNOME 3 aka &quot;Gnome Shell&quot;) which was using new technologies (Clutter, GTK3), which had a completely different design and implemented a radically different paradigm than its predecessor but which used the same namespaces and thus it couldn&#39;t be installed alongside GNOME 2. Following the decision from Debian to upgrade GNOME to version 3, GNOME 2 was no longer available in Linux Mint.</p><p>To tackle this issue two new projects were started:</p><ul><li>A project called <strong>MATE</strong> was started by a developer called Perberos. Its goal was to rename and repackage GNOME 2 so that it could be just as it was before.</li><li>A project called <strong>MGSE</strong> was started by Linux Mint. Its goal was to develop extensions for GNOME 3 to give it back some of the functionality it had lost and which was available in GNOME 2 (a panel, a systray, an application menu, a window-centric alt-tab selector, a window-list..etc).</li></ul><p>Linux Mint 12 shipped with both MATE and GNOME3+MGSE.</p><p>6 months later and after a huge amount of work, MATE was becoming stable, and from a set of extensions MGSE became a fork of GNOME 3 called Cinnamon.</p><p>Linux Mint 13 was the first Linux release to ship with the Cinnamon desktop. Since then Linux Mint has a MATE and a Cinnamon edition, both providing users with a conservative desktop paradigm, one forked from GNOME 2 and the other forked and derived from GNOME 3.</p><hr><h2 id="processes" tabindex="-1">Processes <a class="header-anchor" href="#processes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Processes&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Binary view of the various processes within a Cinnamon session"></p><p>The figure above shows the various processes at play within a Cinnamon session.</p><p>After you log in, the following processes are automatically started:</p><ul><li><code>cinnamon-session</code> (the session manager which starts all the other processes)</li><li><code>cinnamon</code> (which is the visual part of the cinnamon desktop)</li><li><code>nemo-desktop</code> (which handles the desktop icons and desktop context menu)</li><li><code>cinnamon-screensaver</code> (the screensaver)</li><li>various <code>csd-*</code> processes (which are settings daemon plugins and run in the background)</li></ul><p>The <code>nemo</code> process starts when you browse files and directories.

The main <code>cinnamon</code> process implements the <code>libmuffin</code> library and therefore runs both the visible components (panel, applets, etc.) and the window manager.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>muffin</code> package also provides a <code>muffin</code> binary. This binary is a small program which implements <code>libmuffin</code> and provides a minimal window manager, sometimes used by developers for troubleshooting. Whether or not <code>muffin</code> is installed by default in Linux Mint, it doesn’t run by default in a Cinnamon session. The <code>cinnamon</code> process, which also implements <code>libmuffin</code>, is the default window manager.</p></blockquote><p>The clutter and cogl libraries are also part of the <code>muffin</code> package now.</p><p>Muffin is developed in C and the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/muffin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><h3 id="cjs" tabindex="-1">cjs <a class="header-anchor" href="#cjs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;cjs&quot;">​</a></h3><p>CJS is Cinnamon’s JavaScript interpreter.
